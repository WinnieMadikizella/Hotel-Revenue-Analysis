# Hotel-Revenue-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes hotel revenue trends using SQL and Power BI. The dataset includes information from 2018 to 2020 for two hotel types, segmented by various metrics.

## Objectives
1. Build a database to store and manage the data.
2. Use SQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and retrieve insights.
3. Connect Power BI to the database for advanced visualizations.
4. Answer key business questions:
   - Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
   - Should we increase our parking lot size based on guest trends?
   - What seasonal trends can be observed in average daily rate and guest counts?

## Project Pipeline
1. **Build a Database**: Load data from Excel into SQL Server and create a unified dataset.
2. **Analyze Data with SQL**: Perform EDA and answer business questions using SQL queries.
3. **Visualize Data in Power BI**: Connect Power BI to the database and create interactive dashboards.
4. **Summarize Findings**: Document key insights and recommendations.

## Key Insights
- Revenue increased from 2018 to 2019 but decreased in 2020.
- Trends in parking lot usage do not show much difference.
- Seasonal variations in ADR (Average Daily Rate) highlight peak and off-peak periods, August being the peak period.
